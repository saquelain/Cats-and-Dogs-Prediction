# Cats-and-Dogs-Prediction

This is a android studio project integrated with machine learning
I have integrated tensorflow lite model(cats and dogs prediction with .tflite file) into the android studio and made a simple ui to interact with.
In this app, you can use your custom image to predict, since it is already pretrained model, it will not train at the time of using app to reduce heavy uses of cpu.
